        * Oxides of nitrogen (NOx).
        * Oxides of sulphur (SOx).

A major and downplayed factor affecting human health is indoor air pollution. This is particularly a concern in households with gas stoves and furnaces requiring pilot lights, which can cause dangerous buildups of carbon monoxide (CO). CO is the most prolific toxic killer in human history. Pilot lights require several fail-safe measures to prevent CO buildup, and these fail-safes must be continuously monitored and tested.

Electrification eliminates the need for pilot lights, because it removes the need for combustible-fuels entering your home in the first place.

        Electricity can be smokeless at both ends: generation **and** end use. Generation is critical. There are only a very narrow range of options for ensuring smoke-free electricity generation:
        * Hydro.

        * Nuclear.
        Because VRE depends on dispatchable power sources, a VRE-intensive system must include either hydro or nuclear or both. Most electricity systems in Canada have already tapped their available hydro resources. This leaves only nuclear as the backbone of expanded electricity generation.
