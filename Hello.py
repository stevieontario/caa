    We advocate for proven, realistic ways to achieve clean air, through actual clear energy. The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec are the two greatest examples in North America of the electrical transition that is coming. Both have uncommonly clean electricity. Quebec&mdash;with long, cold winters&mdash;heats mostly with electricity, one of the few jurisdictions in North America that does so. Given that heating represents by far the single biggest energy use category in all Canadian provinces, that&#8217;s quite an achievement.

    Ontario originally depended on hydropower, but as it grew it developed North America&#8217;s largest nuclear power generation fleet, based on technology invented in Canada by Canadians.

    Together, Quebec and Ontario show the way forward with electrification: 
    1. Heat electrically.
    2. All new generation capacity should be nuclear.

We advocate for clean power generation with nuclear power, and general electrification across industry, the economy, and society. Specific areas of focus are
* Electrification
* A Just Transition in energy and environment that maximizes worker well being while minimizing the environmental benefit of energy production and use.
* Ontario&#8217;s electricity transition (most innovation in Canada will occur in Ontario, so it&#8217;s important)
* Urban air quality
* Municipalities (they are where electrification will mostly occur)
* Energy and electricity forecasting

Learn more about these areas of focus by exploring the topics in the sidebar.

By far the main source of energy use and GHGs in Canada is from heat production, for large scale liquid-fuel feedstock manufacturing. This chiefly occurs in Alberta\'s oilsands, and the main energy usage, and GHG emissions source, is burning natural gas to provide heat and chemicals for the main stages of oilsands processing. These consist of separating bitumen from sand and manufacturing hydrogen.')

Decarbonizing this activity requires electrifying it. At the current usage level, this would require upward of 12,000 megawatts of new non-emitting electricity generating capacity across the country. This has the potential to eliminate some 85 million tons of GHGs annually from Canada&rdquo;s national inventory. Electrifying all road and rail transport could eliminate a further 60 million tons.')
