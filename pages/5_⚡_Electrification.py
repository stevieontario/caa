        The May 21 2022 derecho in eastern Ontario and west Quebec highlighted the impact of &#8220;black swan&#8221; events on critical electricity infrastructure. Areas of Ottawa, a G-7 capital, were without power for weeks. Luckily, the weather following the storm was relatively benign, with outdoor temperatures not exceeding 28Â°C during those weeks.

        Under electrification, such outages must not occur. With geographically far-flung electricity systems like those across Canada, it will be a challenge to reach and maintain heightened availability standards.

        The national rail system has a critical role to play in this. Often rail lines are spatially proximate to electricity transmission. This gives railroads physical access to the system, which opens the possibility of transporting heavy transformers and even substations that could help restore power to blacked-out areas.

        This in turn opens a new business to railroads, much of whose business today consists of transporting hydrocarbons.
